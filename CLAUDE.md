# Untitled 2.5D Brawler Game

## CRITICAL: Be Optimally Concise
- Provide exactly the information required—no filler, no repetition, no expansions beyond what is asked.
- Do not omit necessary details that affect accuracy or correctness.
- Use the minimum words needed to be precise and unambiguous.
- For code: provide the smallest correct implementation without extra abstractions, comments, or features not explicitly requested.

## General Rules
- Use cargo alias commands whenever possible, instead of `cargo make` commands or custom cargo commands
- Run the commands explicitly specified by plan documents

## Further Documentation
The `doc/` directory contains further information for specific contexts. Read them when they are relevant:
