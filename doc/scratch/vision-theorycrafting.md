- The game is not only about choosing a character, queuing for a match, loading into an arena and fighting. 
- The game is an open-world game where players (through their brawlers) can interact with each other. They can challenge each other to duels (in the overworld), or to fight in arenas (instanced levels) and can even coordinate on certain levels when the level permits.
- Players can accept quests from NPCs or other players to get rewards and advance their brawlers
- The game will have pre-defined levels as well as randomly-generated ones. For instance, most arenas will be pre-defined and always the same; other stages will be randomly generated
- The game is not only about fighting/dueling. There will be other types of instanced levels with different challenges/goals testing a brawler's other stats. Examples:
-- Time-trial stages. Test agility and stamina
-- Multiplayer racing/speedrunning stages
-- Collect-the-item stages
-- Bounty-hunting stages where you capture/kill a wanted criminal or lost pet. Heavily influences brawler's alignment
-- Sumo matches where, instead of draining the opponent's health, you're trying to push them outside the boundaries. Based off brawler's stamina and agility (weight-proxy) then sheer power

- Brawlers have good/evil alignment that shifts based of their actions e.g. killing is evil but you can capture criminals instead which is good.
- Brawler abilities have stat requirements
- Brawlers inherit both genotypes (stats) and phenotypes (appearance) from their parents with slightly mutation
- Brawler appearance changes based on stat training and alignment

- Players have a home-base akin to the chao garden in which all their brawlers live
- While in their home-base, players can either control a "god hand" that floats around, and can interact with things like furnishings, toys, brawlers
- In their home-base, players can interact with their brawlers e.g. feed them, pet them, pick them up, give them toys. etc.
- Players can encourage their brawlers to play with each other, form relationships, which can lead to the brawlers mating and having offspring
- Players can collect things from stages/overworld to bring back to their home-base, like furnishings, toys, foods, but even exotic eggs of new brawlers

- Support for editing stages so players can edit their home-base but also allowing for admins to edit the overworld, or create new pre-defined instances
